    <p>According to Britannica, "Education, discipline that is concerned with methods of teaching and learning in schools or school-like environments as opposed to various nonformal and informal means of socialization (e.g., rural development projects and education through parent-child relationships)".
     <p1>According to statista, "While universal access to education is declared in the UN Declaration of Human Rights, access to education vary greatly across the world. Ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all was deemed the fourth most pressing issue worldwide by the UN in 2015. While only two percent of the adult population in Europe and Central Asia were illiterate, one third in Sub-Saharan Africa was the same. Nevertheless, there has been a significant increase of both people in education and people completing primary education since 2000. Around 90 percent of the world’s population had completed a primary education in 2020, whereas 66 percent had attained a secondary education. The numbers were even lower in tertiary education, with around 40 percent of the global population having attained some kind of tertiary education, most of which were women. Adult men are on average more literate than women, reflecting the unequal access to education for women and men in many countries, but the literacy gender gap has shrunk among the world’s younger generations in recent years."
